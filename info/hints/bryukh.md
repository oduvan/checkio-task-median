## I have no idea how to start solving this mission

As first you need to define the length of the array.
You can use the built-in function **len()**.

## I need some help to proceed with the mission

With the builtin operator "modulus" you can define if a number even or odd.

    if n % 2 == 1:  # odd

## I am gone half way through. Need help!

If you are using python3, then don't forget that "/" is a real division, "//" is an integer division.

## I am stuck. I need a small hint.

Don't forget to sort the array.

## I tried all I could. Nothing works. SOS

All that you need is to find the middle.

It can be len(array) // 2 or (len(array) // 2, len(array) // 2 - 1)
