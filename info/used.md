The median has usage for Statistics and Probability theory, it has especially significant value for skewed distribution. For example: we want to know average wealth of people from a set of data -- 100 people earn $100 in month and 10 people earn $1,000,000. If we average it out, we get $91,000. This is weird value and does nothing to show us the real picture. In this case the median would give to us more useful value and a better picture. The Article at Wikipedia.
